Topics range from basic concepts in programming to discipline-specific tools for research.

Our goal in sharing this material is to help you build your skills in using WestGrid, Compute Canada and
other advanced research computing tools to support your research, no matter what your skill level or
discipline may be.

This repository will be continually updated as we deliver sessions on new topics or revise materials on
past topics.

If there are topics or materials that you would like to see us add, please contact info@westgrid.ca.
