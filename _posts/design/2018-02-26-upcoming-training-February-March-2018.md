WestGrid regularly hosts free online training webinars. We always have a session every second Wednesday
and sometimes will hold additional sessions outside of that schedule to expand on particular topics.

Some sessions are interactive and may require you to have a Compute Canada account. Others are
information-sharing only and no Compute Canada is required.

For more information on each session, or to register and receive the webinar connection details, click on
