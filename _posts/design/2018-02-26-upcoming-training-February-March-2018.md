WestGrid regularly hosts free online training webinars. We always have a session every second Wednesday, and sometimes will schedule additional sessions outside of that schedule to expand on particular topics.
Some sessions are interactive and may require you to have a Compute Canada account. Others are information-sharing only and no Compute Canada is required. 
For more information on each session, or to register and receive the webinar connection details, click on the links below.
