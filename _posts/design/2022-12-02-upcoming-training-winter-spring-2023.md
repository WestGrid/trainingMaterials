<!-- While WestGrid ceased its operations on March 31, 2022, research computing training in Western Canada remains -->
<!-- -- coordinated by the same team, now based at Simon Fraser University, with participation from HPC analysts -->
<!-- across the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group (former WestGrid space). -->

To receive future news and emails about the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group training events, please
[subscribe here](/contact).

<!-- Going forward, this new list will be our primary way to reach academic researchers in Western Canada (and -->
<!-- elsewhere). -->

<a name="courses"></a>
## Online courses

We offer weekly online sessions on advanced research computing. These sessions take place every Thursday from
10am to noon Pacific and are open to all academic researchers across Canada. Most courses span 3 weeks,
although some courses may be shorter or longer.

<!-- We will post the program here by early January. -->

Please note that these sessions are not recorded, as we want to encourage attendance and live interaction, and
we are planning to repeat the most popular / introductory sessions throughout the year.
