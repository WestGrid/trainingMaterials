<!-- While WestGrid ceased its operations on March 31, 2022, research computing training in Western Canada remains -->
<!-- -- coordinated by the same team, now based at Simon Fraser University, with participation from HPC analysts -->
<!-- across the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group (former WestGrid space). -->

To receive future news and emails about the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group training events, please

<a name="courses"></a>
## WestDRI online courses

Starting in early February, 2023, we will offer weekly online sessions on advanced research computing. These
sessions will take place every Thursday from 10am to noon Pacific. Most courses will span 3 weeks, but of
course some courses may be shorter or longer.

<!-- We will post the program here by early January. -->

Please note that these sessions will not be recorded, as we want to encourage attendance and live
interaction. And we are planning to repeat the most popular / introductory sessions throughout the year.
