## New mailing list

<!-- While WestGrid ceased its operations on March 31, 2022, research computing training in Western Canada remains -->
<!-- -- coordinated by the same team, now based at Simon Fraser University, with participation from HPC analysts -->
<!-- across the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group (former WestGrid space). -->

To receive future news and emails about the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group training events, please
[subscribe here](http://eepurl.com/h-yBFL){:target="_blank"}. Going forward, this new list will be our primary
way to reach academic researchers in Western Canada (and elsewhere).

## Webinars

BC DRI + Prairies DRI bi-weekly Research Computing webinars take place every second Tuesday at 11am Pacific
/ noon Mountain / 1pm Central.
