## New mailing list

<!-- While WestGrid ceased its operations on March 31, 2022, research computing training in Western Canada remains -->
<!-- -- coordinated by the same team, now based at Simon Fraser University, with participation from HPC analysts -->
<!-- across the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group (former WestGrid space). -->

To receive future news and emails about the BC DRI Group and the Prairies DRI Group training events, please

way to reach academic researchers in Western Canada (and elsewhere).
