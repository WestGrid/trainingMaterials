<a name="courses"></a>
## Online courses

SFU Research Computing offers weekly online sessions on advanced research computing. These sessions take place
every Thursday from 10am to noon Pacific and are open to all academic researchers across Canada. Most courses
span 2 weeks, although some courses may be shorter or longer.

Please note that these sessions are not recorded, as we want to encourage attendance and live interaction, and
we are planning to repeat the most popular / introductory sessions throughout the year.

## Other local bootcamps and workshops

We will be adding workshops here as they are announced at other Western Canadian universities.

## In-person schools

Typically at the end of a term we organize a longer, in-person research computing school at SFU that is open
to all students, postdocs, faculty and staff. We will add more information here.
