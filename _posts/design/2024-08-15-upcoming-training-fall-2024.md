## Online courses

We offer weekly online sessions on advanced research computing. These sessions take place every Thursday from
10am to noon Pacific and are open to all academic researchers across Canada. Most courses span 3 weeks,
although some courses may be shorter or longer.

Please note that these sessions are not recorded, as we want to encourage attendance and live interaction, and
we are planning to repeat the most popular / introductory sessions throughout the year.
