We offer a number of on-site training courses on a wide range of topics related to scientific computing,
high-performance computing, data analysis, and visualization. These workshops can take any form from one
hour to multiple days and are free to researchers and groups from WestGrid's partner institutions.

If you are looking for this or any customized training or would like to host a workshop,
[please let us know](mailto:info@westgrid.ca). We design the workshop, coordinate the preparations,
advertise the event, and provide the instruction. We expect the host to provide an auditorium or
classroom space free of charge, assist with advertising the session locally, and allow any member of the
research community to attend the training (i.e. this may include researchers from outside your
institution). If you prefer to run a small, invite-only session for a select audience, please contact us
to discuss.

Courses are scheduled at various times of the year and at various institutions, based on demand. Each
year around May-July we host two four-day-long summer schools, traditionally one in Southwest BC
(Vancouver or Victoria) and one east of the Rockies (Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba). Our summer
schools typically have 12-15 half- or full-day courses over several parallel streams.

<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Moving your research from Windows-based desktops to Linux and command line in remote servers</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to Linux command line and the interaction with a
remote server. We review basic Linux commands, file management (edit, copy, remove and remote-transfer
files), directories and the file system, remote access, basic version control (Git, GitHub), Bash scripts
and basic Bash programming.

<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Introduction to HPC: using clusters to speed up your research</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

We start with an overview of the hardware of common HPC clusters and quick description of the resources
available on Compute Canada's national systems (Cedar / Graham / Niagara / BÃ©luga). We then continue
learning the basic tools and techniques to work on a cluster: software environment and modules, overview
of installed programming languages and compilers, working with makefiles and installing new software
locally. Finally, we take a look at the Slurm job scheduler: why use it, fairshare and priority,
submitting serial jobs and job arrays, submitting OpenMP / MPI / hybrid / GPU jobs, working inside
interactive jobs, and tracking your job's memory usage. We also take a quick look at working with common
packages such as R, Python and Matlab on the clusters, as well as best practices in cluster workflows.

<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Introduction to scientific visualization with ParaView: plotting, interactive 3D, scripting, animation, large datasets</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

We start with simple 1D/2D/3D plotting using plot.ly. The rest of the day we study 3D scientific
visualization with ParaView, an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed
to run on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users
can interactively visualize 2D and 3D data sets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes
or particles, animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView
supports both interactive (GUI) and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and is an easy and fun
tool to learn.

<details>
<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Introduction to scientific visualization with VisIt</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

This a VisIt-flavoured version of the previous workshop.

<details>
<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Large-scale 3D remote visualization</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

This an advanced version of the ParaView-based visualization course focusing on parallel
rendering, interactive client-server remote visualization, batch workflows using both cluster's CPUs and
GPUs.

<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Foundations of parallel programming and the Chapel programming language</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

This course is a general introduction to the main concepts of parallel programming and the
Chapel programming language. Chapel is a relatively new language for both shared and distributed-memory
programming, with easy-to-use, high-level abstractions for both task and data parallelism that make it
ideal for learning parallel programming for a novice HPC user. Chapel is incredibly intuitive, striving
to merge the ease-of-use of Python and the performance of traditional compiled languages such as C and
Fortran. Parallel constructs that typically take tens of lines of MPI code can be expressed in only a few
lines of Chapel code. Chapel is open source and can run on any Unix-like operating system, with hardware
support from laptops to large HPC systems.

<details>
<summary>
<a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1">Python-based Software Carpentry</font></a>
</summary>
<p>

This is a two-day workshop that includes 1/2-day of Bash, full day of Python, and 1/2-day Git
introduction.
