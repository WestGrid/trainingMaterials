#### *"Geospatial analysis with HPC"*

**Webinar** (2019-Dec-11) by Ian Percel

This webinar provides an introduction to basic tools of spatial data analysis and modelling that are available as open
source libraries in Python. It consists of two parts: GeoPandas and the parallelization of spatial joins.

The first portion of the talk introduces the core API of GeoPandas and emphasizes how it can be used to link relational
data structures to geometric objects that represent spatial subsets. This includes a brief introduction to loading data
from geodatabases, mapping, aggregating, spatial filtering, and simple spatial joins. The second portion of the talk
focuses on how to implement parallel versions of spatial join operations. This examines alternatives that have been
developed in the data science community for providing more efficient handling of GEOS pointers and subclassing Dask
DataFrames.
