Within these pages we have compiled past training materials from our online training webinars, in-person workshops, and
multi-day Summer School events. Topics range from basic concepts in programming to discipline-specific tools for
research.

Our goal in sharing these materials is to help you build your skills in using various advanced research computing tools
to support your research, no matter what your skill level or discipline may be.

This repository will be continually updated as we deliver sessions on new topics or revise materials on past topics.

If there are topics or materials that you would like to see us add, please contact `rc dash training at sfu dot ca`.
