## Webinars

#### *"Introduction to deep learning with fastai"*

**Webinar** (2021-Apr-14) by Marie-Hélène Burle

fastai is a deep learning library with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art
results in standard deep learning domains. It also provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and
matched to build new approaches.

fastai aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is
possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning
and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions.

This webinar takes a closer look at the features and functionality of fastai.
