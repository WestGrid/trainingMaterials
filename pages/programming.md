#### *"Intro to Parallel Programming in Chapel"* three-part webinar

In this three-part online webinar series, we introduce the main concepts of the Chapel parallel
programming language. Chapel is a relatively new language for both shared- and distributed-memory
programming, with easy-to-use, high-level features that make it ideal for learning parallel programming
for a novice HPC user.

Unlike other high-level data-processing languages and workflows, the primary application of Chapel is
numerical modelling and simulation codes, so this workshop is ideal for anyone who wants to learn how to
write efficient large-scale numerical codes.
